### **Name of the Project**:

**DutyCircle**

### **List of Team Members**:

- [Nico](https://x.com/codelawani)

### **Description of the Project**:

DutyCircle is a unique application designed to merge task management with public accountability. Users can create and manage personal tasks while also choosing to share them publicly. The public sharing feature transforms a simple task into a commitment, offering users an external motivation to accomplish their goals. The public feed showcases tasks from various users, giving an opportunity for users to connect over shared objectives or interests. Users can form accountability circles where they can nudge each other for pending tasks, strengthening the community feel and adding an extra layer of motivation.

### **Learning Objectives**:

1. **Integration of Frontend and Backend**: Achieve a seamless interaction between the Next.js frontend and the Postgresql backend.
2. **Understanding Public Accountability**: Delve into the psychological aspects of public commitment and its impact on task completion rates.
3. **Mastering Next.js**: Grasp the capabilities of Next.js including SSR, API routes, and the broader ecosystem.
4. **Database Management**: Learn efficient task management and user interaction storage using Postgresql.

### **Technologies Used**:

1. **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework)
2. **Backend**: Built-in API routes provided by Next.js
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL

### **Third Party Services Used**:

1. **Deployment**: Vercel for Next.js and Neondb for PostgreSQL.
2. **Authentication**: Using Third-party services -- NextAuth for user login and registration.
3. **Notifications**: (If in future iterations) Services like SendGrid for email notifications or Twilio for SMS.

### **Challenges Already Identified**:

1. **Learning Curve**: Mastering Next.js and its features while integrating with PostgreSQL.
2. **Real-time Updates**: If considering real-time features in future iterations, the challenge of implementing and managing WebSocket connections or similar solutions.
